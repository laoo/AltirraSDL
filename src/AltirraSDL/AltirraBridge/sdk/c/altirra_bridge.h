/*
 * AltirraBridge C SDK — minimal client for the AltirraBridge protocol.
 *
 * This is a single-file dependency: altirra_bridge.h + altirra_bridge.c.
 * Drop both into any C or C++ project. libc + Winsock are the only
 * dependencies. No external libraries.
 *
 * The protocol is line-delimited UTF-8: send a verb + space-separated
 * arguments terminated by '\n', read back a single-line JSON response
 * terminated by '\n'. The SDK handles transport, framing, and the
 * HELLO authentication handshake. Higher-level command wrappers are
 * added per-phase as the protocol grows.
 *
 * See AltirraBridge/docs/PROTOCOL.md for the full wire contract.
 *
 * Threading: not thread-safe. Use one atb_client_t per thread.
 *
 * Error handling: every function that can fail returns an int with 0
 * for success and a negative atb_err_* code on failure. The most
 * recent error message is available via atb_last_error(client).
